      <description>A little bit about me: I participated in the F=ma competition all four years of high school, and ended up making the US Physics Camp in junior and senior year of high school. In junior year, I was also part of the International Physics Olympiad team, where I won a gold medal as a part of the first and only all-gold US IPhO Team.
Notes My notes on physics olympiads are located here.</description>
