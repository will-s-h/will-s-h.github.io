      <description>A little bit about me: I participated in the F=ma competition all four years of high school, and ended up making the US Physics Camp in junior and senior year of high school. In junior year, I was also part of the International Physics Olympiad team, where I won a gold medal as a part of the first and only all-gold US IPhO Team.

      <description>Clue  The USESO counselors are often hard at work coordinating many of the events occuring throughout the week. Sometimes, to blow off a little steam, we host counselor-only events, such as high-stakes poker and high-octane garticphone. In one of these high-octane garticphone events, James was shown with a prompt with one of our names that James couldn&amp;rsquo;t draw, so instead he chose a color to represent the name. What color did James choose?</description>
