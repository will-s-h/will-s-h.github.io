      <description>There was no way of knowing whose version would finally be adopted Once again he glanced at his rival in the opposite cubicle.

I&amp;rsquo;ve been a Warriors fan since the We Believe rag-tag squad topped the number one seed—okay actually I wasn&amp;rsquo;t a Warriors fan back then.</description>
