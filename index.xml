      <description>The following provides an explanation of C++ memory allocation, including static variables and dynamic memory allocation.
C++ Memory Overview In C++, memory is allocated in four different segments:
 text/code segment, where executable instructions are stored. data segment, which is divided into two components:  initialized data segment, where global and static variables that are initialized are stored. uninitialized data segment, also called the BSS segment, where data is initialized by the kernel to 0 before the program&amp;rsquo;s execution.</description>

      <description>This is a C++ guide from the perspective of an amateur programmer of several programming languages. It focuses on the unique syntax and structure of C++ compared to other languages. It&amp;rsquo;s mainly a place where I document to myself important differences of C++ that I must keep in mind while programming.
Table of Contents   Memory Allocation in C++   .h vs. .cpp, file compilation stuff (to be added)   Classes and Structs   Pointers and References   Notice About C++ Practices All code segments introduced in this guide assumes the following lines are included at the top of every program:</description>

      <description>A little bit about me: I participated in the F=ma competition all four years of high school, and ended up making the US Physics Camp in junior and senior year of high school. In junior year, I was also part of the International Physics Olympiad team, where I won a gold medal as a part of the first and only all-gold US IPhO Team.
Notes My notes on physics olympiads are located here.</description>

      <description>Introduction During my time in high school, I participated in the United States Astronomy and Astrophysics Olympiad (USAAAO) for three years, as well as the International Olympiad in Astronomy and Astrophysics for the last two of those years, winning gold medals in both years. In my senior year of high school, I also helped contribute problems to the USAAAO.

      <description>Clue  The USESO counselors are often hard at work coordinating many of the events occuring throughout the week. Sometimes, to blow off a little steam, we host counselor-only events, such as high-stakes poker and high-octane garticphone. In one of these high-octane garticphone events, James was shown with a prompt with one of our names that James couldn&amp;rsquo;t draw, so instead he chose a color to represent the name. What color did James choose?</description>
