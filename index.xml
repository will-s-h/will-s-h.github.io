      <description>About Me I&amp;rsquo;m William Huang, an undergraduate at Stanford studying ???? and ????. A resume might be uploaded somewhere here soon.
Fun Facts I&amp;rsquo;m a Warriors fan—not a bandwagon. The distinction is important to me. I&amp;rsquo;ve been a Warriors fan back when Oracle Arena was our arena. I&amp;rsquo;ve been a Warriors fan since I&amp;rsquo;ve been a Warriors fan since Monta Ellis was our best player. I&amp;rsquo;ve been a Warriors fan since the We Believe rag-tag squad topped the number one seed—okay actually I wasn&amp;rsquo;t a Warriors fan back then.</description>
