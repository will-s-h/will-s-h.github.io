      <description>Clue  The USESO counselors are often hard at work coordinating many of the events occuring throughout the week. Sometimes, to blow off a little steam, we host counselor-only events, such as high-stakes poker and high-octane garticphone. In one of these high-octane garticphone events, James was shown with a prompt with one of our names that James couldn&amp;rsquo;t draw, so instead he chose a color to represent the name. What color did James choose?</description>

      <description>Clue  I exist in everything from sports to school
And I rhyme with something that floats.

But once I&amp;rsquo;m finished you&amp;rsquo;ll be shook.
